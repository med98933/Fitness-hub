                <p><b>CONCENTRIC:</b> The contracting "positive" aspect of the lift.</p><br/>
                <p><b>DB:</b> Dumbell.</p><br/>
                <p><b>DOMS:</b> Delayed onset muscle soreness.</p><br/>
                <p><b>ECCENTRIC:</b> The lowering "negative" aspect of the lift.</p><br/>
                <p><b>EFFORT:</b> How hard you are pushing the set relative to failure. Measured with RPE and/or %RM.</p><br/>
                <p><b>FREQUENCY:</b> How often you directly train a given muscle or lift every seven days.</p><br/>
                <p><b>HYPERTROPHY:</b> Efford and Load.</p><br/>
                <p><b>LOAD:</b> The weight of the externalresistance.</p><br/>
                <p><b>LSRPE:</b> The last RPE.</p><br/>
                <p><b>PERIODIZATION:</b> The organization of training over time.</p><br/>
                <p><b>PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD:</b> The gradual increase of stress placed upon the body during exercise training. In training contexts, this generaly envolves progressivly increasing some lifting parameter over time "usually increasing weight/reps or improving technique/mind-muscle connection".</p><br/>
                <p><b>ROM:</b> Range of motion.</p><br/>
                <p><b>RPE:</b> Rate of percieved exertion. A measure of how difficult a set was on a 1-10 scale, with 10 meaning muscular failure was acheived. An RPE of 8 means you could have gotten two more rep, an RPE of 8 means you could have gotten two more reps, etc.</p><br/>
                <p><b>TEMPO:</b> The speed at which the lift occurs.</p><br/>
                <p><b>VOLUME:</b> Total amount of work performed.Usually approximated as tough working sets.</p><br/>
